# DevOps Product Hunting

## Before starting

The project is maintained in a private Gitlab repository, but is mirrored and shared publicly in this Github repository. This avoids a potential security hole with the exploitation of sensible unprotected variables accessible and used during Merge Requests by a FinOps tool.

## Purpose

This project is intended for learning purposes, to better understand **how an application is deployed following the DevOps methodology**.

Several themes related to DevOps are explored:
- CI/CD pipeline;
- Cloud infrastructures;
- Dev responsibilities: code, test, build, release;
- Ops responsibilities: infrastructures, review & production, deploy, operate, monitor;
- FinOps integration: monitor and optimize cloud computing costs.

**All this will be deployed from scratch** in order to better understand the responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer within a company.
